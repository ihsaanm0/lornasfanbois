# TeachHub by lornasFanBois

**Target Audience:** Young teachers who have been in education for fewer than five years.

## Introduction
The dilemma that is being addressed by this project is the issue of low retention of new teachers in education, specifically teachers who have been teaching for less than five years. This issue impacts on factors such as the quality of education students receive, a shortage of teachers with increasing student numbers, and an aging teacher population that is not being replaced or passing on skills. While this is not an issue that can be directly addressed and solved here, tools can be developed to help mitigate factors that contribute to this issue. This project aims to develop an application that will enable teachers to establish a community, and seek and provide support and resources to one another.

<br />

The first factor this aims to mitigate is the large amount of additional planning work teachers are expected to do outside work hours. This is an issue that has been directly attributed to new teacher attrition. With the introduction of the national curriculum, many teachers are delivering similar lessons and content, and are expected to plan each lesson they delivers, without being given time within work hours to do so. TeachHub allows teachers to share lesson plans, content, and advice on effective teaching methods. This will help new teachers develop skills, and reduce the amount of additional work teachers much complete outside work hours. Additionally, it will help teachers find mentors, and develop a sense of community, which is another factor that impacts teacher retention.

<br/>

Many new teachers who leave education identify a lack of support and mentorship as a heavy contributor to their choice. New teachers are not given adequate support and guidance in order to develop necessary skills to succeed. This issue stems in part from teachers not having spare time to take on additional roles as they are occupied with their own workload. Through TeachHub, new teachers will be able to connect with each other and more experience teachers, and develop a support network where they can seek guidance and mentorship, as well as reduce their considerable workload.


## Concept

TeachHub aims to create a community in which teachers can communicate, share and discover teaching methods and resources, new technologies and how to use them. The application will mainly focus on asynchronous distributed interaction where teachers will create, post, reply in forums. The web application will allow teachers to create and share lesson plans and use ready-made plans across a range of subjects. Lesson plans will have a rating system included which will allow teachers to see how effective the plan is and whether or not it will suit their circumstances. Teachers will also be able to get advice on teaching methods and how to deal with trouble students through a forum provided by the website.

Group meetings: 12pm, Thursdays in Hawken Engineering Building (50)

<br />


The team will work collaboratively, and employ a diplomatic approach to decision making and idea generation and development. **Trello** will be used to list tasks that require completion. Group members will nominate tasks they wish to complete, and may employ their own work style in order to complete that task, providing the task is complete by the required deadline to a high standard. Underperforming group members member will be notified of their underperformance and reminded of their responsibilities towards the group. If this does not resolve the issue, course teaching staff will be consulted in order to resolve the issue. 

<br />

The project will utilise a user-centred design approach, and as such most decisions will be made based on feedback received from users. Where decisions must be made by the group, a diplomatic majority approach will be adopted. Group members will vote on a desired solution, and the majority vote will decide how to proceed. Conflict will be resolved by trial by combat.
 
## Communication

The primary method of communication for the project will be Slack, with Google Docs and Drive used for collaboration and filestorage. File names will be meaningful (e.g. explain what the file is) and named in camelcase. These platforms have been chosen due to their familiarity (Google Drive), and integration with the course (Slack). Slack is a centralised service that is convenient for sharing many different types of media, and offers functionality that facilitates group collaboration (e.g. pinning important information, integration with Google Drive, real-time chat).
Trello will be used to keep fellow team members informed of what is being worked on. Tasks will be posed in Trello, and team members will indicate when they are working on that task. This will increase the efficiency and communication of the team.

### Milestone 1 <br />
Project Phase: Research<br />
_Concludes: Friday, Week 7 (08/09/17)_<br /><br />
Milestone 1 will be the research phase of the project, and result in foundational research that will inform the teams early prototypes, and assist the project team compile a list of pain points and gain generators for the target audience. These assets will inform the development of early prototypes.
<br />

Key deliverables: <br />
* Solid foundational research from which to begin developing low fidelity prototypes for user testing.<br />
* Pain points for target audience identified.
* Gain generators for target audience identified.
* Begin defining an <span title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</span>.

### Milestone 2

Project Phase: Requirements and User Testing <br />
Standup: Tuesday, 12/09/17 <br />
_Concludes: Friday, Week 8 (15/09/17)_<br /><br />

This milestone will include the project team presenting their progress in a standup. Currently, Milestone 2 is intended to be a rapid iteration of low-fidelity, horizontal prototyping and user testing. The goal of this milestone is to generate a design direction to begin development of an electronic prototype, and begin defining the MVP of the final system. Through this approach, the project team plans to allow enough time to produce a complete model of a functional system for the Digital Showcase. <br />

<br />
Requirements will be drawn from interviews and research performed in Milestone 1. <br/>
<br/> 

Key deliverables: <br />
* User testing results from performing paper prototyping.
* A design direction that provides the project team with a starting point to begin development of an electronic prototype. 
* Wireframe drafts of the web application interface.

## User Testing
User testing refers to having users, or representative users (education students) perform testing sessions on parts of the system. Different sessions will be run throughout the project and catered to the specific goals of testing sessions. For example, early testing will be performed using paper prototypes, with users asked to complete tasks, and give feedback about their experience. Usability testing will also be performed on fellow interaction design students in order to refine the overall user experience, and ensure best practise is being adhered to.
